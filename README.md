# Ai-Yogesh Chatbot (or your project name)

A Gradio-based chatbot interface powered by the DeepSeek (or your chosen) language model.  This application provides a user-friendly way to interact with the AI, including features like code extraction and display, a cancel button (API-dependent), and a full-screen chat interface.

## Features

*   **Interactive Chat:**  Engage in conversations with the AI model.
*   **Code Extraction and Display:**  Code generated by the AI is automatically extracted, formatted, and displayed in a readable way, making it easy to copy and use.
*   **Cancel Button (API-Dependent):** A cancel button is included to attempt to stop the AI's response (note: actual cancellation depends on the API's support).
*   **Full-Screen Interface:**  The chat interface occupies the full browser window for an immersive experience.
*   **Copyable Code:** Code blocks are displayed in a way that makes them easy to select and copy.
*   **(Optional) Avatar Images:** Includes custom avatar images for the user and the bot.
